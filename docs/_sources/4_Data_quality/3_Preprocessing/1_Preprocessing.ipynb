    "# Pre-processing\n",
    "- Proper pre-processing is a prerequisite for stability, reproducability, performance and interpretability.\n",
    "    - Stability: Reducing the impact of noise and outliers and transforming to a common distribution.\n",
    "    - Reproducability: Common practices for pre-processing to ensure the results are valid across users, institutions etc.\n",
    "    - Performance: Simplifying the job of the machine learning by not having to learn trivial generalisations (e.g., means, scales, etc.).\n",
    "    - Interpretability: Being able to compare and recognise across datasets, methods and projects. Trusting the observed plots, statistics, etc."

    "- Decomposition: Fast Fourier Transform, Direct Cosine Transform, Seasonal Trend decomposition by LOESS smoothing, detrending by subtracting a smoothed signal."

    "- Imputation: Exchanging missing (or outlying) data with an estimate/guestimate based on training data or neighbours.\n",
    "- Time formatting: Representing measurements in a common time format and time zone.\n",
    "- Synchronisation: Making the measurements in two or more time series correspond (time points and resolution), e.g., by removal of non-overlapping regions, time accumulation or interpolation.\n",
    "- Encoding: Transform time series into variograms."
