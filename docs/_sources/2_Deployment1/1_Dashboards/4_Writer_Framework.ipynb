    "- Install _writer_.\n",
    "- Create (and open) _hello_ project.\n",
    "- Play with the project in \"Preview\" mode, testing functionality.\n",
    "- Focus on \"User Interface\" mode:\n",
    "    - Left bar: Layout, Content, Input, Other.\n",
    "    - Left bar: Component Tree.\n",
    "    - UI elements, click and edit properties.\n",
    "        - Double-click on Tabs to reveal contents.\n",
    "    - Move elements and add new ones.\n",
    "    - Value binding between elements (see [documentation](https://dev.writer.com/framework/builder-basics)).\n",
    "- Inspect and tweak \"<> Code\" focusing on:\n",
    "    - _initial\\_state_ (bottom of Python code, [documentation](https://dev.writer.com/framework/application-state)).\n",
    "    - Use of leading _underscore in states and functions to be private to the backend (not connected to UI).\n",
    "    - Application state notation, @{...}, in UI element properties and corresponding Python code.\n",
    "        - Nested states, e.g., @{building.height}, or for dynamic access: @{building[dynamic_prop]}\n",
    "    - Event handling ([documentation](https://dev.writer.com/framework/event-handlers)).\n",
    "        - From Python, assignment of states trigger detection/action, e.g., state[\"counter\"] = something + something_else.\n",
    "- Open the project in your favourite editor (IDE).\n",
    "    - F.ex. in VS Code: File -> New Window, File -> Open Folder..., choose _hello_.\n",
    "    - Changes in code and JSON files should be directly detected by writer."
