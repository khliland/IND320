    "- Ideally, this means being able to recreate report contents at any time.\n",
    "    - Markdown, Jupyter Notebooks, RMarkdown and similar frameworks are popular open alternatives for such reports.\n",
    "    - Power BI Report Builder is the Power BI equivalent with options similar to Power BI Desktop, but optimised for paginated output, e.g., PDF without interactivity.\n",
    "    - Redo datahandling, calculations and visualisations at the time of rendering/compilation.\n",
    "    - Underlying data must be available, possibly using a local copy.\n",
    "        - Copy-pasting from various sources is a no-go.\n",
    "- Version control can be used to trace any changes to data, code or text.\n",
    "    - Even though the project may continue and the report evolve, a snapshot from a certain timepoint is always available."

    "- A digital report can retain some interactivity, e.g., Plotly interactions.\n",
    "    - With some effort, also more advanced interactivity can be included, e.g., in an .html formatted report or an online report in services like Power BI.\n",
