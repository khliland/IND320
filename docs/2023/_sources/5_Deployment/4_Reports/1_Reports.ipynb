    "## Reproducibility\n",
    "- In many projects, e.g., those based on Data-Driven Desision Making, transparency, traceability and reproducibility are important.\n",
    "- Ideally, this means being able to recreate report contents at any time.\n",
    "    - Markdown, Jupyter Notebooks, RMarkdown and similar frameworks are popular open alternatives for such reports.\n",
    "    - Power BI Report Builder is the Power BI equivalent with options similar to Power BI Desktop, but optimised for paginated output, e.g., PDF without interactivity.\n",
    "    - Redo datahandling, calculations and visualisations at the time of rendering/compilation.\n",
    "    - Underlying data must be available, possibly using a local copy.\n",
    "        - Copy-pasting from various sources is a no-go.\n",
    "- Version control can be used to trace any changes to data, code or text.\n",
    "    - Even though the project may continue and the report evolve, a snapshot from a certain timepoint is always available."

    "## Graphics\n",
    "- \"A picture is worth a thousand words\" is an old cliche, but still valid.\n",
    "- Eye catching, yet informative graphics with descriptive captions can carry most of the message in anything from a glossy paper brochure to a research article.\n",
    "    - In a report, text is inevitable as context, background, interpretations and conclusions are hard to convert to graphics that are universally understandable.\n",
    "- A digital report can retain some interactivity, e.g., Plotly interactions.\n",
    "    - With some effort, also more advanced interactivity can be included, e.g., in an .html formatted report or an online report in services like Power BI.\n",
    "    - Interactivity can engage the reader more, partially by just being more fun, but also because it feels more tangible and personal."

    "- Numbers can be communicated in various ways depending on the type and function.\n",
    "- Key Performance Indicators (KPI) are single figures that show some important summary, e.g., gross income, increase in sales since last period, a competitive index, etc.\n",
    "    - These are typically highlighted in a report possibly grouped together and placed visibly.\n",
    "- Tables can be needed for increased precision or as background material for graphs.\n",
    "    - Formatting can highlight what we want the reader to focus on.\n",
    "    - Pivoting, grouping and summarising can give a much easier interpretation than large tables."
