    "When a system wide change like adding/changing environment variables or installing a program is performed, this does not appear in the current session of a Jupyter Notebook or other module that is started (directly or indirectly) from the command line. A restart of the whole Jupyter Notebook server may therefore be needed after the mentioned changes to see their effects.\n",

Instead they have a Software Center with installable programs. For NMBU the Software Center includes Anaconda, VS Code, Docker (with automatic WSL installation), Java, and Power BI Desktop."
