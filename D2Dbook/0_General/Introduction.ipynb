    "- Basic functionality requires Python (originally built with version 3.12.4) and packages _matplotlib_, _numpy_, _json_, _datetime_.\n",
    "- For more advanced plotting: _plotly_.\n",
    "- For databases:\n",
    "    - E.g., [docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) with [Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/cassandra/getting_started/installing.html) database having the expected tables.\n",
    "    - Python packages _cassandra-driver_, _cql_\n",
    "    - PySpark has different requirements from platform to platform. See [Installation](../7_Appendix/Installation.ipynb).\n",
    "- For APIs:\n",
    "    - Python packages _requests_, _flask_\n",
    "- For machine learning:\n",
    "    - Python packages _pandas_, _scikit-learn_ (or quicker/more scalable implementation)\n",
    "- Compiling the full book requires several programs and packages, but all Jupyter Notebooks can be run separately.\n",
    "    - Python packages: _jupyter-book_ and all above.\n",
    "    - A running Flask server with the _flask\\_API.py_ active.\n",
    "    - Cassandra running locally, e.g., using Docker.\n",
