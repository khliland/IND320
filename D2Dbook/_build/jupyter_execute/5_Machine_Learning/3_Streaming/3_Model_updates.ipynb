    "## Model updating\n",
    "- As seen when using _river_, a sentralised modelling and prediction system can be updated realtime based on incomming data.\n",
    "- In practice this comes with some caveats:\n",
    "    - Faulty or biased data can give an undesired shift in the model (e.g., [Twitter taught Microsoftâ€™s AI chatbot to be a racist asshole in less than a day (2016)](https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/24/11297050/tay-microsoft-chatbot-racist))\n",
    "    - Some control is lost with regard to verification and validation.\n",
    "- [Continuous Integration (CI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) typically involves pushing updates often to a version control system where testing and building is performed once a day (nightly build)."

    "### Model deployment\n",
    "- Traditional software (and model) development cycles have typically involved alpha and beta testing phases for internal or limited user groups before full deployment with long upgrade cycles.\n",
    "- [Continuous Delivery (CD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery) is public release counterpart of CI, often performed in an integrated loop with short cycles.  \n",

    "- For software/models with large user groups, canary deployment can be employed to reduce possible damage from faulty updates.\n",
    "    - A copy of the production system is made and the new features/properties are applied to the copy.\n",
    "    - Small user groups, either randomly chosen or selected through developer programs, are given access (unknowing or willingly).\n",
    "    - Feedback and adoption is used for approval for full deployment or adjustment before a new canary cycle.\n",
    "- Companies like Spotify perform testing on user groups, setting up statistical experiments where the effect of changes to user interfaces and music recommendation algorithms can be measured real-time."
