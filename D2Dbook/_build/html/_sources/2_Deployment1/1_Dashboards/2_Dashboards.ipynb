    "    - Free is usually only free in the development phase.\n",
    "    - Some paid services also include deployment on a server, easy scaling to meet demands, etc.\n",
    "    - For companies with custom built projects, infrastructure may already be available in-house or through a contract with Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform or other agreements.\n",
